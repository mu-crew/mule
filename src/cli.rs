Hand mule a command, get an id back, then poll, wait or tail against that id.
You never see ssh, never see tmux, and never hold a connection.

mule uses its OWN ssh ControlPath, so it cannot contend with git fetch, rsync or
anything else on the default socket. The mule channel is never lent to local
commands like rsync or git fetch.

Operational facts:

  * mule does NOT open the ssh master. `ssh -MNf` needs a TTY for a hardware
    token and cannot prompt from a background call. This costs one token tap per
    ControlPersist window.

    Exit 3 means the master is missing, and it needs a HUMAN: someone may have
    to touch a hardware key. If you are an agent or a script, STOP and ask the
    operator to run the printed command. Do not retry, do not run `ssh -MNf`
    yourself, and do not fall back to `ssh host command` -- that holds a session
    channel for the whole job, which is the failure mule exists to remove.
  * jobs run in a NON-login, NON-interactive shell, so login profiles do not
    run. Bash still sources ~/.bashrc over ssh, so a PATH set there does reach
    a job; ~/.bash_profile does not run, so a version manager's `activate` has
    not happened. Put its shims dir on PATH in ~/.bashrc, or source what you
    need in the command: mule run 'source ~/.zshrc && npm test'.
  * stdout and stderr are merged into one log, in the order the job wrote them;
    redirect inside your command to separate them.
  * poll and wait print NO job output; `mule tail <id>` is the output verb.
  * do NOT pipe your command into head or tail. `rc` becomes the pipe's, so a
    failed build reports 0 and every `&&` after it proceeds. mule already
    shapes the output for you: `mule tail <id> -n 3` instead of `| tail -3`.

Exit status:
  0   mule operation or job succeeded
  3   no ssh control master
  4   timed out waiting
  5   orphaned job
  6   connection dropped while waiting
  <n> wait/--wait return the job's own exit code"
