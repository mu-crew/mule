/// One round trip, and a bounded number of processes regardless of job count.

/// The previous version was a shell loop forking four processes PER JOB -- a
/// `cat` for `rc`, a `tmux has-session`, a `stat`, and a `base64` for `cmd`.
/// Measured at 300 jobs: **14.1s**, all of it inside the ticket lock, so
/// nothing else mule-related could run. That breaks mule's own rule against
/// holding a capped channel for more than about a second, and since `keep_days`
/// defaults to 14, a few hundred jobs is ordinary rather than pathological.
///
/// Now three processes total -- one `tmux list-sessions`, one `find -exec stat`,
/// one `awk` -- and **0.13s** for the same 300 jobs, a 108x improvement. What
/// each step bought, measured separately: dropping per-job `has-session` took
/// 14.1s to 5.8s (each was a separate tmux client connection), batching `stat`
/// took it to 2.4s, and moving the file reads into awk took it to 0.13s.
///
/// Two portability notes, both load-bearing rather than defensive:
///
/// `stat`'s flags are mutually exclusive between BSD and GNU -- `-c` is an
/// illegal option on macOS and `-f` means "file system" on Linux -- so the
/// `||` fallback is required, not belt-and-braces.
///
/// `cmd` is base64-encoded inside awk. A command may contain a tab or newline,
/// either of which would corrupt the row format. Keeping the encoder in the
/// existing awk process avoids restoring the per-job `base64` forks that made
/// listing take 14.1s. The same batched stat includes `cmd` and `rc`: spawning
/// one stat per artifact would undo that improvement.
